					<h2>Literacy and Numeracy</h2>

						<blockquote>"I'm a visual thinker, not a language-based thinker. My brain is like Google images".
																				<p> -Temple Grandin<p></blockquote>

							<p>Students with learning difficulties (also known as learning disabilities or disorders) find it challenging to learn effectively in the areas of literacy and/or numeracy. These students typically perform well below the expected level in one or more academic areas and need additional assistance to achieve in the classroom. In Australia approximately 16 per cent of children have a learning difficulty, with 3 per cent having a severe ongoing learning difficulty[1]. Learning difficulties tend to impede the acquisition and use of skills in one or more of the following areas: reading, writing, mathematics or oral language.</p>

							<p> Students with learning difficulties may display some of the following characteristics at school: </p>

								<ul>
									<li>Difficulty with reading, writing and/or mathematics</li>
									<li>Easily distracted and less focused than other students</li>
									<li>Slow to start a task and generally have difficulty completing a task</li>
									<li>Tend to enjoy sport, physical education, art and craft and drawing</li>
									<li>Lack internal motivation to learn academic pursuits</li>
									<li>Lack the ability to think things through</li>
									<li>Inclined to rush work, say the task is ‘boring’ and produce sloppy written work</li>
									<li>Lack self-esteem and tend to follow others’ lead </li>
									<li>Present as passive learners who appear to be daydreaming</li>
									<li>Have difficulty transferring and generalising skills from one task to another</li>
									<li>Inclined to call out and not take turns</li>
									<li>Prefer ‘hands on’ tasks and activities</li>
									<li>Less likely than other students to seek out teacher support</li>	
									<li>Demonstrate a specific learning difficulty, such as difficulty with reading</li>
								</ul>



						<p>There are many types of learning difficulties and several difficulties can coexist, thus a child may experience a number of learning difficulties. The following are some common specific learning difficulties.<p>


					<h3>Dyslexia </h3> 

						<p>Reading disability <em>problems related to phonemic awareness and fluency.</em> Students with dyslexia have difficulty decoding words and reading aloud fluently. They usually have average intellectual skills but have difficulty with working memory and visual processing speed. A psychologist usually diagnoses dyslexia after a child meets a number of criteria including being well below the expected reading level for their age.</p>


					<h3>Working memory difficulties</h3>
					
						<p> <em>A reduced ability to temporarily hold information</em> in memory for a brief period and to then use this information in the course of ongoing thinking.Children with working memory problems have a reduced capacity to temporarily store information in their memory, and thus can have difficulty carrying out multistep activities, following or repeating lengthy instructions, or correctly answering mental arithmetic. Many children with working memory problems appear to have early difficulties with phonological processing, auditory memory and expressive language.</p>

					<h3>Visual processing disorder</h3>

						<p>Difficulty processing visual symbols such as letters and numbers.</p>

					<h3>Auditory processing disorder</h3>
					
						<p> <em>Difficulty processing speech and sounds</em> Students who have difficulty processing speech and sound do not have trouble with their hearing, but have difficulty making sense of what is heard.</p>


			    	<h3>Dyspraxia</h3>
					
						<p> <em>Difficulties with coordination of motor skills</em> These can be oral (difficulty making sounds), motor (difficulties with fine and gross motor skills), or verbal (difficulties creating speech because of issues with coordination of lips and tongue).</p>


				    <h3>Dysgraphia</h3>

 						<p> <em> Writing difficulties </em> with written language, including handwriting and setting out written information on the page.</p>

				    <h3>Dyscalculia</h3>

						<p> <em>Mathematics disability</em> difficulty learning mathematical concepts and facts, and setting mathematical problems out on the page.<p>

				   <h3>Non-verbal learning difficulty</h3>
				
 						<p><em>Difficulties processing and interpreting visual spatial information </em>These students tend to explore and mediate the world verbally. They have difficulties with most areas of learning involving right hemisphere thinking, motor coordination, social interactions and peer relations, self-esteem, comprehension and personal organisation.<p>

				    <h3>Attention and concentration difficulties</h3>
				
						<p> <em>Problems associated with chronic tiredness </em> and lack of sleep, on-going trauma and emotional issues or disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)—difficulties with the ability to concentrate, sit alertly and remain task-focused.</p>
