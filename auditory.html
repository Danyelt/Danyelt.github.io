					<h3>Auditory processing disorder</h3>

						<p> Auditory processing disorder (also known as central auditory processing disorder or CAPD) is a condition that makes it hard for kids to recognize subtle differences between sounds in words.</p>

						<p>Students with APD typically have normal hearing, however they struggle to process and make meaning of sounds. This is especially true when there are background noises, making an effective learning environment difficult.</p>

				

					<h4>What skills are affected by auditory processing disorder?</h4>

						<p>Experts agree that children can learn to work around challenges they face when dealing with APD. But APD can present lifelong difficulties if it isn’t diagnosed and managed. Here are some skills that are commonly affected:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Communication: Students with APD may not speak clearly. They may drop the ends of words and syllables that aren’t emphasised. They might confuse similar sounds (free instead of three) long after their classamtes have learned to correct themselves.</li>

								<li> Academics: Students with APD often have trouble developing reading, spelling and writing skills. Learning vowels and developing phonemic awareness—the building blocks for reading—can be especially difficult. Understanding spoken instructions is challenging, students with APD tend to perform better in classes that don’t rely heavily on listening. </li>

								<li>Social skills: Kids with APD have trouble telling stories or jokes. They may avoid conversations with peers because it’s hard for them to process what’s being said and think of an appropriate response.</li>

							</ul>
