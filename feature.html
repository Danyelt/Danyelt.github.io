<!---Vision-->
			<h3><em>Vision</em></h3>
					<h3>VoiceOver</h3>

						<p> VoiceOver is a gesture-based screen reader. When is VoiceOver enabled, triple-click the Home button to access it in whatever app you are in. Hear a description of everything happening on your screen, from battery level to who’s calling to which app your finger’s on. You can adjust the speaking rate and pitch to suit you. </p>

						<p> To help navigate,a student can use a simple set of gestures to control their iPad. For example, touch or drag your finger around the screen and VoiceOver tells you what’s there, for example:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Tap a button to hear a description; double-tap to activate. </li>
								<li> Swipe up or down to adjust a slider. </li>
								<li>Flick left and right to move from one app to the next. </li>
							</ul>

						<p>When you interact with an element on the screen, a black rectangle appears around it, so sighted users can follow along. When you prefer privacy, you can activate a screen curtain to turn off the display so no one can see it, even as you’re controlling it. And when VoiceOver is talking, the volume of any background audio from music or video automatically lowers, ‘ducking’ under the voice, so you can hear VoiceOver clearly. <p>
				</br>
					<h3> Zoom </h3>
				
						<p> Zoom is a built-in magnifier that works wherever you are in iOS, from Google Classrrom and Safari to the Home and Lock screens. Turn Zoom on for full-screen or picture-in-picture mode, allowing you to see the zoomed area in a separate window while keeping the rest of the screen at its native size. You can adjust the magnification between 100 and 1,500 per cent, and access multiple filter options in either mode. While you’re zoomed in, you can still use all of the familiar gestures to navigate your device. And Zoom works with VoiceOver, so you can better see — and hear — what’s happening on your screen. <p>

				</br>

					<h3> Speak Screen </h3>
				
						<p>If you have a hard time reading the text on your iOS device, use Speak Screen to read your email, iMessages, web pages and books to you. Turn on Speak Screen and swipe down from the top with two fingers, or just tell Siri to Speak Screen and have all the content of the page read back to you. You can adjust the voice’s dialect and speaking rate, and have words highlighted as they’re being read. </p>
				</br>

					<h3> Siri </h3>
			
						<p> Siri, Apple’s intelligent assistant, helps you do the things you do every day.1 All you have to do is ask. Say something like “Tell Jay I’m running late” or “Remind me to make a booking for Saturday”. Siri can send messages, place phone calls, schedule meetings, and even turn on and off VoiceOver, Guided Access and Invert Colours. And because Siri is integrated with VoiceOver, you can ask where the nearest sushi restaurant is and hear the answer read out loud. </p>
				</br>

					<h3>Dictation </h3>

						<p>Dictation lets you talk where you would type. Tap the microphone button on the keyboard, say what you want to write, and your iOS device converts your words (and numbers and characters) into text. So it’s easy to type an email, note or URL — without typing at all. </p>

<!---Lit and Num -->
			<h3><em>Literacy and Numeracy</em></h3>

				<h3>Guided Access</h3>
					<p>Guided Access helps people with autism or other attention and sensory challenges stay focused on the task (or app) at hand. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button, and limit the amount of time spent in an app. You can even restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen. So wandering taps and gestures won’t distract from learning. </p>

				<h3>Speak Screen</h3>
					<p>Students learn different ways. Some of us learn better when more than one sense is engaged simultaneously. If you have a learning disability like dyslexia, Speak Screen can help with reading. Turn on Speak Screen and swipe down from the top with two fingers, or just tell Siri to Speak Screen and have all the content of the page read back to you. You can also have words highlighted as they’re being read so you can follow along. Even the voice’s dialect and speaking rate can be adjusted to suit your needs.</p>

				<h3>Dictionary</h3>
					<p>Say you’re reading an article on astronomy and are stuck on some terminology. Just look it up — dictionary definitions are integrated into iOS. Get quick access to definitions and commonly used phrases to help with spelling, pronunciation and grammar.</p>


				<h3>Safari Reader</h3>
					<p>For some students, navigating the web can be a sensory overload. Safari Reader reduces the visual clutter on a web page by removing distractions. It strips away ads, buttons and navigation bars, allowing you to focus on just the content you want. And Safari Reader works with Speak Selection and VoiceOver, to provide auditory reinforcement for what you’re seeing.</p>


				<h3>Speech</h3>
					<p>Students with speech impairments can also benefit from iOS features. FaceTime lets you communicate visually, whether you use sign language, gestures or facial expressions. iMessage lets you chat with others via text. And Speak Selection helps with speech development by speaking the words you’re reading. Or you can compose your own text and have your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch speak for you. There are also over 100 third-party speech apps that can turn your iOS device into a powerful augmentative communication device.</p>

<!---Physical and Motor-->

			<h3><em> Physical and Motor Skills</em></h3>

						<h3>AssistiveTouch</h3>
							<p>iOS devices are remarkably intuitive and easy to use. And AssistiveTouch lets you adapt the Multi-Touch screen of your iOS device to your unique physical needs. So if you have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, you can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger. You can create your own gesture and even customise the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. And if you have trouble pressing the Home button, you can activate it with an onscreen tap. Gestures like rotate and shake are available even when your iOS device is mounted on a wheelchair. And iOS devices also support a number of third‑party assistive devices that help you interact with your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.</p>

					</br>

						<h3>Switch Control</h3>
							<p>Built directly into iOS, Switch Control is a powerful accessibility technology for anyone with impaired physical and motor skills. Switch Control allows you to navigate sequentially through onscreen items and perform specific actions using a variety of Bluetooth-enabled switch hardware. Switch Control is customisable for both beginners and advanced users — you can simplify existing actions or create your own.</p>

					</br>

						<h3>Siri</h3>
							<p>Siri helps students do the things you do every day. All you have to do is ask. Say something like “Remind me ti hand in my Maths homework” or “Remind me to tell mum I have a school excursion”.  You can even use Siri to turn on Invert Colours and Guided Access.</p>

					</br>

						<h3>Touch Accommodations</h3>
							<p>With Touch Accommodations, you can adjust how the screen responds to your touch. Control how long you touch before it’s recognised or whether repeat touches are ignored. So you can put your finger down anywhere on the screen and move to the item you want without mistakenly performing an action.</p>

					</br>
				


						<h3>Dictation</h3>
							<p>Dictation lets you talk wherever you would type. Tap the microphone button on the keyboard, say what you want to write, and your iOS device converts your words (and numbers and characters) into text. So it’s easy to type an email, note or URL — without typing at all.</p>

					</br>

						<h3>Predictive Text</h3>
							<p>Tap to choose the perfect suggestion for your next word — predictive text adjusts results based on who you’re talking to and what you’ve said before.</p>

						<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
							<p>If there’s a word or phrase you frequently use, create a customised shortcut — and iOS will type it out for you. For example, “appt” can expand to “appointment” or “cyl” to “Call you later”. Keyboard shortcuts make it easier and faster to type your name, email address, home address or any other text that you commonly type.</p>

<!---Audio-->	

				<h3><em>Auditory</em></h3>						

					<h3>Mono Audio</h3>
						<p>When you’re using headphones, you may miss some audio if you’re deaf or hard of hearing in one ear. That’s because stereo recordings usually have distinct left- and right-channel audio tracks. iOS can help by playing both audio channels in both ears, and letting you adjust the balance for greater volume in either ear, so you won’t miss a single note of a concerto or word of an audiobook.<p>


					<h3>Made for iPad Hearing Aids</h3>
						<p>Apple has worked with top manufacturers to create hearing aids designed specifically for iPhone. These hearing aids deliver a power-efficient, high-quality digital audio experience, and will allow you to manage yur hearing aid straight from your iPad.</p>
